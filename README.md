# file-converter
This is a basic file converter using the package `convertapi` to convert the files. The App is rendered in windows which are created with `tkinter`.

## Usage
To use this tool yourself you have to create an account on [convertapi.com](https://www.convertapi.com/) and get your API Secret.
Put this secret into an .env file inside the root folder of the tool like this
```javascript
API_SECRET = <your_secret>
```

Alternatively you can just start `main.py` which will give you a prompt to enter the API Secret.
